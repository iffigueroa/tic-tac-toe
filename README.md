# React Tic-Tac-Toe 

This project contains code from the React Tic-Tac-Toe tutorial: https://react.dev/learn/tutorial-tic-tac-toe

To run tic-tac-toe clone this repo and run the following command: 
```
npm start
```

A localhost window will launch. 

This tic-tac-toe game maintains history, so you can go back and review previous steps in the game

### Improvements: 
- Reviewing previous history is a little clunky 
    - Example: You can pick up the game from previous steps but the history log doesn't clear until you've started playing
    - Maybe allow user to review previous step instead? 
    - Add undo/redo button instead 
- Game doesn't show a draw when board is full
- Allow users to enter names
